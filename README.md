# Apside Community

**Wild Code School's Hackathon challenge** in collaboration with Apside, from 29/06 at 3pm to 01/07/2022 at 11am.

## Apside

Apside Group is an IT consulting and engineering company with arround 3000 consultants helping from ideation to operational maintenance as well as through IT and industrial development in France and Abroad.

## Goal

Apside explained us a problem they were facing : lack of colaboration and communication between entities of the group that created redundance, ineficiencies and lost of time. They want a new tool or sratégy to help the teams across France to share what they were working on to other and share information and create synergies.

## Our proposal : Apside Community

A tool that let a project manager to login and create a new project. This platform let the project manager describe the problematic he/she's facing and how the project solve it : 

One could access other project achievment and progress threw a 'news feed', follow other project that would have interesting solution proposal in a favorites section and of course search for new ideas and other existing project threw a search tool. 

Linked with all collaboration tools, and accessing all workers ressources, Apside Community aims to become a centralised platform for decentrilised innovation process.
