## Goal

Apside explained us a problem they were facing : lack of colaboration and communication between entities of the group that created redundance, ineficiencies and lost of time. They want a new tool or sratégy to help the teams across France to share what they were working on to other and share information and create synergies.

## Our proposal

A tool that let a project manager to login and create its new project. This platform let the project manager describe the problematic he/she's facing and how the project solve it. 

One could access other project achievment and progress threw a 'news feed', follow other project that would have interesting solution proposal in a favorites section and of course search for new ideas and other existing project threw a search tool.
